# shterm-alt

The utility serves an [Xshell](https://www.xshell.com/)-like command line interface for SSH URLs (`ssh://username:password@host[:port]`), and opens SSH session with [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) (should be accessible from `$env:PATH`) instead. It was initially designed to work with [ShtermClient](https://www.qzsec.com/qz/product/RIS_ACM.html).
